display.c / display.h
Purpose:

Implements the interface for controlling a 20x4 character LCD display using a 4-bit parallel connection via GPIO.
Provides functions for initializing the display, setting the character position, and writing strings.
Features:

Initialization sequence for 4-bit mode communication.
Functions to write instructions and data to the display.
Functions to set the cursor position on the display (for 4 lines).
Function to write null-terminated strings to the display.
Uses HAL library for GPIO control.
Handles the initial 8-bit communication steps required to switch to 4-bit mode.
Main Functions:

displayInit() - Initializes the LCD display. This includes the initial 8-bit communication attempts, setting the display to 4-bit mode, configuring the number of lines and font, turning the display on, clearing the display, and setting the entry mode.
displayCharPositionWrite(uint8_t charPositionX, uint8_t charPositionY) - Sets the cursor position to the specified row (charPositionY) and column (charPositionX). It uses pre-defined addresses for each of the four lines of the display.
displayStringWrite(const char *str) - Writes a null-terminated string to the display at the current cursor position.
displayCodeWrite(bool type, uint8_t dataBus) - Writes a byte to the display, either as an instruction (type = DISPLAY_RS_INSTRUCTION) or as data (type = DISPLAY_RS_DATA). This function manages the RS, RW, and EN control signals.
displayDataBusWrite(uint8_t dataBus) - Writes the data to the 4-bit data bus. This function handles the sending of the upper and lower nibbles with the appropriate enable pulses.
displayPinWrite(uint8_t pinName, int value) - Writes a value (HIGH or LOW) to a specific display pin using the HAL GPIO library.
