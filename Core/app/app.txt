app.c
Purpose:

Implements the application layer for the Bare Metal Event-Triggered System (ETS).
Manages task execution, WCET (Worst-Case Execution Time) monitoring, and system updates.
Coordinates initialization and periodic execution of tasks in a structured manner.
Features:

Initializes and executes multiple tasks (e.g., sensor, system, and actuator).
Monitors execution time for each task to identify worst-case performance.
Periodically logs WCET values for system performance analysis.
Integrates a cycle counter to measure execution time accurately in microseconds.
Main Functions:

app_init() - Initializes the application, resets counters, and executes task-specific initialization routines.
app_update() - Executes task update functions, measures execution time, updates WCET values, and logs performance periodically.
app_log_performance() - Prints the WCET values for all tasks to the logger.
HAL_SYSTICK_Callback() - Handles system tick interrupts and increments tick counters for tasks.
